# Developer Notes

## Build: 2025-03-19

### Completed in this build
- Set up the basic project structure with necessary dependencies
- Implemented configuration management (loading/saving Cloudinary credentials)
- Added interactive file selection using `fzf`
- Implemented Cloudinary API integration for uploading files
- Created CLI interface with subcommands (init, upload, config)
- Added support for basic transformations (WebP, AVIF)
- Implemented parallel uploads using Tokio for better performance
- Added progress bar for upload tracking
- Implemented URL saving to file

### What needs to be done next
1. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for configuration management
   - Add integration tests for file selection and uploads
   - Test across different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)

2. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Add more robust error handling for network failures
   - Implement retry logic for failed uploads
   - Add better validation for user inputs

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Add support for more transformations
   - Implement asset management (listing, deleting)
   - Add support for tags and metadata
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed assets

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile and optimize upload performance
   - Add chunked uploads for large files
   - Implement connection pooling for multiple uploads

5. **Documentation**:
   - Improve inline code documentation
   - Add more examples to the README
   - Create a user guide with common use cases

## Notes on Async Implementation
- Using Tokio for async runtime and task management
- Leveraging futures for parallel uploads
- Using bounded channels for backpressure in future implementations
- Need to optimize error propagation in async context

## Code Organization
- Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- Configuration management in `config` module
- Cloudinary API integration in `cloudinary` module
- CLI commands in `commands` module
- Utility functions in `utils` module

## Next Release Planning
- Target v0.2.0 with improved error handling and more transformations
- Target v0.3.0 with asset management features
- Target v1.0.0 with comprehensive testing and documentation
